**Design Achievements**
I actively ensured to use 12 tips from W3C to make my site accessible.
1. Developing Tip: Associated a label with every form control.
2. Developing Tip: Helped users avoid and correct mistakes through error messages (Alerts to fill in required fields when not filled in, alerts telling user when they have entered incorrect password).
3. Developing Tip: Wrote code that adapts to users technology (Used Bootstrap to make 3 required task information all on one line for wide screens, separate line for smaller screens).
4. Designing Tip: Provided sufficient contrast between foreground and background using light foreground and dark text.
5. Writing Tip: Provided clear instructions through error messages when the user has made a mistake.
6. Designing Tip: Provided clear and consistent navigations options through buttons.
7. Designing Tip: Ensured that each form element has a clearly associated label
8. Designing Tip: Created designs for different viewport sizes using Bootstrap
9. Writing Tip: Kept content clean and concise (concise login page, clean main page not overflooded with information)
10. Designing Tip: Made interactive elements easy to identify (Buttons, mouse changes on hover making it clear that it can be clicked)
11. Designing Tip: Did not use color alone to convey information (Used asteriks on all required fields, with message below in red saying "Required fields marked with a *")
12. Writing Tip: Used headings to convey meaning and structure (Login heading for login page, To do list heading for main page -> both describe main meaning and goal of page)
